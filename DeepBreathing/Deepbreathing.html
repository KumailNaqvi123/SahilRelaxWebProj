                <h2>Deep Breathing</h2>
                <p>
                  When people are stressed,their breath tends to be shallow and rapid.Making a concious attempt to breath more deeply can help you relieve stress.

                <h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Sajjad uses Deep Breathing to beat stress!</h2>
                <p>
                  I had not slept properly at night and didn't feel prepared for the exam. As soon as I saw the first few questions, my head started spinning.
                  I couldn't recall ever seeing word problems like the ones that stared back at me from the question paper: they were long, heavily worded, and tedious.
                  My stress went sky-high.<br></br> 
                  Fortunately, the teaching assistant in charge noticed my meltdown and came over. Realizing what had happened, he asked me to focus on my breathing, and take slower,
                  deeper breaths. Within a few minutes, I started feeling much better and calmed down enough to take another look at the question paper before me. Second time around,
                 it actually didn't look that bad. I was able to figure out that underneath the complex wording, the problems were rather simple.<br></br>

                Since then I have perfected my technique of deep breathing by learning more about it and using it as often as needed. It is quick, it is simple, and it works.

                    <h2>The Technique</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                1. Sit comfortably with your spine erect and shoulders relaxed. Keep a gentle smile on your face.<br></br> 
                2. Place your left hand on the left knee, palms open to the sky or in Chin Mudra (thumb and index finger gently touching at the tips).<br></br>
                3. Place the tip of the index finger and middle finger of the right hand in between the eyebrows, the ring finger and little finger on the left nostril, and the thumb on the right nostril. We will use the ring finger and little finger to open or close the left nostril and thumb for the right nostril.<br></br>
                4. Take a deep breath, allowing the air to fill your lungs and stomach.<br></br>
                5. Press your thumb down on the right nostril and breathe out gently through the left nostril.<br></br>
                6. Now breathe in from the left nostril and then press the left nostril gently with the ring finger and little finger. Removing the right thumb from the right nostril, breathe out from the right.<br></br>
                7. Breathe in from the right nostril and exhale from the left. You have now completed one round of Nadi Shodhan pranayama. Continue inhaling and exhaling from alternate nostrils.<br></br>
                8. Complete 9 such rounds by alternately breathing through both the nostrils. After every exhalation, remember to breathe in from the same nostril from which you exhaled. Keep your eyes closed throughout and continue taking long, deep, smooth breaths without any force or effort.
